We create a Bayesian network to identify whether a Coin is Biased Coin or fair Coin. The Decision about Coin biased is made from data observed-various experiments and results.Based on these experimental results, We determine and update our belief about the coin whether it is biased or not. We basically Start with prior and keep updating our prior w.r.t the data observed. The Prior is an Beta Distribution, Likelihood is Binomial Distribution and we update the Prior which is Posterior which shows us the confidence which tells the coin is Biased or Not.
